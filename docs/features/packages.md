# Packages

> Starting with version 9.1, the [Laravel Lang Publisher][link_source] project can work with an unlimited number of packages containing localization files.

For a manager to work, you need to do two things:

1. Install the package into your application. For example, `composer require andrey-helldar/lang-translations --dev`.
2. Specify the namespace of the package in the configuration file of your app:
   > // config/lang-publisher.php
   >
   > ```php
   > <?php
   > 
   > return [
   >     // ...
   > 
   >     'packages' => [
   >         'andrey-helldar/lang-translations',
   >     ],
   > ];
   > ``` 

In order for the manager to successfully process the specified package, its structure must be strictly observed:

```
source/          - The directory must include files with English localization (original).
locales/         - The directory includes a list of folders with localization names.
   <locale>/     - The list of valid names is in the Helldar\LaravelLangPublisher\Constants\Locales.
      // files   - Any number of json and php files in the directory.
                   Condition: the file names must match the names from the `source` folder.
```

Now, when the `php artisan lang:update` command is executed, the manager will check the specified packages and automatically update the files in your application.

It's all. Enjoy! 😊
